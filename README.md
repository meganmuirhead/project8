this is a simple app where you can add, edit and delete a user from an html from. the users get added to a table. in the table there will be buttons you can click on to edit or remove the user.  I am using node. 

steps on how to use:
1) fill in the inputs
2) click the "submit" button after you have filled out what you would like (you may leave all the inputs blank if you so wish)
3) you should be redirected to an html table with a list of user/s that have been added. 
4)if you like how the table looks, leave it alone, you are all done with the app
5)if you want to edit a user, click on edit. that will redirect you to a new page. you can update whatever field you so wish. once you are done updating, hit the "Update" button
6) if you want to delete a user, click on "Delete"

the app will have an add user to the table soon, but it isn't there yet

happy coding!
